Thanks for applying to Storypark! This repo contains everything related to our iOS technical screener.

We have designed the process to take less than 2-3 hours to complete, but understand that everyone's availability may be different. Please let me know (roughly) when we can expect your answers. It may take a day or two to review your responses, so hang tight, and we'll give you feedback once one of the team members has looked through things.

# About the screener
- Do take your time, we're specifically looking for idiomatic, documented and tested code. Something you would consider to be production quality.
- You are welcome to use any language you feel comfortable with. The example given is an iOS project. The quality matters more than the framework. You may share your answers how you see fit, generally a zip file or github.com link has been preferred by previous candidates.
- If you're going to go overtime, please stop where you are and describe where you would've taken the project. 

# Questions
1. What's the most interesting technical article you've read recently? What did you like about it and why should we take a look at it?
2. Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. `[[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]`.
3. Given an API endpoint (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storypark/web_developer_screener/master/staff_list.json), containing a JSON encoded list of Staff, create a program to read this file and display all staff (these aren't real staff members or addresses), ordered by name, who live within 2km of our office, which is located at 175 Victoria Street, Wellington (lat: -41.2920728, long: 174.7748162).
  - This output can be displayed however you like, from an iOS/Android/web app to a CLI. Do what you're comfortable with, again with a focus on simple, idiomatic code.

Hat tip to intercom.io, who have blogged about their hiring process and we've based ours on this.
